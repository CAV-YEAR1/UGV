gpio392 - currently in use to send trigger signal to the ultrasonic
gpio394 - usable to read detection from ultrasonic
gpio393 - usable to read detection from ultrasonic
gpio388 - usable to read detection from ultrasonic
gpio395 - usable to read detection from ultrasonic

**modifications for 2 ultrasonics both being triggered by gpio392
--modify hcsr04 constructor in hcsr04.h
--add declarations for exportEchoGPIO, unexportEchoGPIO, setEcho to hscr04.cpp
--declare exportEchoGPIO, unexportEchoGPIO, setEcho to hcsr04.cpp so we don't need to export, unexport or set direction of trigger twice
--add another enumeration to jetsonGPIO.h for the gpio395 pin
--update simpleHCSR04.cpp to support two ultrasonic sensors
